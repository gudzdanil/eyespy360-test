Front-end sources are available from `/src` folder
To work with front-end files:

1. run `npm install`
2. build files
  1. for production
    * build (output to root folder of project): run `npm run build`
  2. for development
    * run local dev server: run `npm run dev` (you have to execute build command first to create build files - dev server keeps changes in memory)
